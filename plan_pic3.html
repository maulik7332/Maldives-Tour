                <p>The Maldives is blessed with about 5% of the global reef area, and 250 species of coral, teeming with over 1000 species of fish. Nearly half those who visit the Maldives snorkel or dive and experience the colorful world beneath the surface. While some dedicate their holiday entirely to experience the magic underwater, others take a more leisurely approach. A dive center is an essential component of any resort and there are more than one dive centers in most of the guesthouse islands. Liveaboards carry their own dive gear if the tour is dedicated to diving and all liveaboards without exception would carry a collection of snorkeling equipment.</p>

                    <p>For a leisurely snorkel you can just wade from the beach to the house reef on most islands. Resorts and guesthouses also organize their very own snorkeling excursions. If you intend to dive, just visit the dive school on the island as soon as you arrive. The dive guides would work out a schedule for you to suit your requirement. Dive schools offer dive courses leading to certification from beginner level to advanced and dive courses are conducted in many languages.</p>
