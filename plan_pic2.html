                <p>The Maldives offers a host of facilities and opportunities to fuel your sense of excitement. Whether you are staying on a plush resort, a hotel in Male’, or in a simple guesthouse on an island in an atoll far away, there is a lot you can choose for yourself or for your family.</p>

                    <p>Entertainment and daily excursions are on the menu wherever you are. Excursions offer an experience for you or your family, to take in more of the Maldives. Sandbanks that dazzle under the midday sun, snorkeling over pristine reefs, and experiencing local island towns is part of half day or full day excursions, what’s more a barbeque on the beach for lunch is often thrown in to get that additional punch to the day’s experience. How about night fishing or dolphin watching, swimming with whale sharks and mantas? On land there is beach volley, tennis, volleyball and badminton. For the kids there are child play areas and fun activities in many of the resorts. </p>

                    <p>If you stay in a guesthouse on an inhabited island, you will have the chance to meet Maldivians, experience local culture and cuisine, and join in what the islanders do for relaxation, playing football in the late afternoon, lounging on one of the joalis near the beach or relaxing over a hot black tea and eating “short eats” in a seaside café.</p>
